# Definition of TypeScript
- TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types and other features to the language. It is designed to improve the development experience by providing better tooling, such as autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring capabilities. TypeScript code is transpiled to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any environment that supports JavaScript. It is widely used in web development, particularly for building large-scale applications with frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js.
