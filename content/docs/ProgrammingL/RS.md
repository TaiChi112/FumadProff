# Definition of Rust
- Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It is designed to prevent memory-related errors through its ownership system, which enforces strict rules on how memory is accessed and managed. Rust supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming. It is widely used in system-level programming, web assembly, game development, and performance-critical applications.
